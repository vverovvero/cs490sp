This is the current unidirectional path tracer I have implemented as part of my study into path tracing theory.

The cairo image library is currently installed on my personal machine (MacOSX), and the code can be compiled with:
gcc -std=c99 -o main -L/usr/local/lib/cairo/ -lcairo main.c -I/usr/local/include/cairo/

To compile on a different machine, you will need to have cairo correctly installed.

TO DO (for 2/14)

/********** Makefile ******************/

Create makefile and resolve compilation issues.
Change to C++
Separate out main.h from main.cpp


/********** Scene Parsing ************/

Primitives: like Plane, Box, etc...
Object instancing?
Transformation

Parse a transformation and apply to primitive, get world coordinates


Restricted set of primitives
OBJ files that have been resized and centered at the origin
Apply basic transformations to them
